\* The algorithm is easier to understand in terms of the set of msgs of
\* all messages that have ever been sent.  A more accurate model would use
\* one or more variables to represent the messages actually in transit,
\* and it would include actions representing message loss and duplication
\* as well as message receipt.
\*
\* In the current spec, there is no need to model message loss because we
\* are mainly concerned with the algorithm's safety property.  The safety
\* part of the spec says only what messages may be received and does not
\* assert that any message actually is received.  Thus, there is no
\* difference between a lost message and one that is never received.
VARIABLES req_msgs
VARIABLES resp_msgs

\* key_data[k] is the set of multi-version data of the key.  Since we
\* don't care about the concrete value of data, a start_ts is sufficient
\* to represent one data version.
VARIABLES key_data
\* key_lock[k] is the set of lock (zero or one element).  A lock is of a
\* record of [ts: start_ts, primary: key, type: lock_type].  If primary
\* equals to k, it is a primary lock, otherwise secondary lock.  lock_type
\* is one of {"prewrite_optimistic", "prewrite_pessimistic", "lock_key"}.
\* lock_key denotes the pessimistic lock performed by ServerLockKey
\* action, the prewrite_pessimistic denotes percolator optimistic lock
\* who is transformed from a lock_key lock by action
\* ServerPrewritePessimistic, and prewrite_optimistic denotes the
\* classic optimistic lock.
\* 
\* In TiKV, key_lock has an additional for_update_ts field and the
\* LockType is of four variants: 
\* {"PUT", "DELETE", "LOCK", "PESSIMISTIC"}.
\* 
\* In the spec, we abstract them by:
\* (1) LockType \in {"PUT", "DELETE", "LOCK"} /\ for_update_ts = 0 <=>
\*      type = "prewrite_optimistic"
\* (2) LockType \in {"PUT", "DELETE"} /\ for_update_ts > 0 <=>
\*      type = "prewrite_pessimistic"
\* (3) LockType = "PESSIMISTIC" <=> type = "lock_key"
\*
\* There's an min_commit_ts field to indicate the minimum commit time
\* It's used in non-blocked reading.
\* TODO: upd min_commit_ts comment.
VARIABLES key_lock
\* key_write[k] is a sequence of commit or rollback record of the key.
\* It's a record of [ts, start_ts, type, [protected]].  type can be either
\* "write" or "rollback".  ts represents the commit_ts of "write" record.
\* Otherwise, ts equals to start_ts on "rollback" record.  "rollback"
\* record has an additional protected field.  protected signifies the
\* rollback record would not be collapsed.
VARIABLES key_write

\* client_state[c] indicates the current transaction stage of client c.
VARIABLES client_state
\* client_ts[c] is a record of [start_ts, commit_ts, for_update_ts, min_commit_ts].
\* Fields are all initialized to NoneTs.
VARIABLES client_ts
\* client_key[c] is a record of [locking: {key}, prewriting: {key}].
\* Hereby, "locking" denotes the keys whose pessimistic locks
\* haven't been acquired, "prewriting" denotes the keys that are pending
\* for prewrite.
VARIABLES client_key

\* next_ts is a globally monotonically increasing integer, representing
\* the virtual clock of transactions.  In practice, the variable is
\* maintained by PD, the time oracle of a cluster.
VARIABLES next_ts

  \* In TiKV, there's an extra flag `rollback_if_not_exist` in the `check_txn_status` request.
  \*
  \* Because the client prewrites the primary key and secondary key in parallel, it's possible
  \* that the primary key lock is missing and also no commit or rollback record for the transaction
  \* is found in the write CF, while there is a lock on the secondary key (so other transaction
  \* is blocked, therefore this check_txn_status is sent). And there are two possible cases:
  \*
  \*    1. The prewrite request for the primary key has not reached yet.
  \*    2. The client is crashed after sending the prewrite request for the secondary key.
  \*
  \* In order to address the first case, the client sending `check_txn_status` should not rollback
  \* the primary key until the TTL on the secondary key is expired, and thus, `rollback_if_not_exist`
  \* should be set to false before the TTL expires (and set true afterward).
  \*
  \* In TLA+ spec, the TTL is considered constantly expired when the action is taken, so the
  \* `rollback_if_not_exist` is assumed true, thus no need to carry it in the message.
