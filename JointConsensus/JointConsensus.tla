CONSTANTS InitialServers, NewServers

CONSTANTS NormalEntry, BeginConfChange, FinalizeConfChange

\* Servers states.
CONSTANTS Follower, Candidate, Leader

\* A reserved value.

----
\* Global variables

\* A bag of records representing requests and responses sent from one server
\* to another. TLAPS doesn't support the Bags module, so this is a function
\* mapping Message to Nat.
VARIABLE messages

\* A history variable used in the proof. This would not be present in an
\* implementation.
\* Keeps track of successful elections, including the initial logs of the
\* leader and voters' logs. Set of functions containing various things about
\* successful elections (see BecomeLeader).
VARIABLE elections

\* Servers list all known servers.
VARIABLE allServers

\* The members of the server at that time.
VARIABLE voters
VARIABLE nextVoters
nodeVars == <<allServers, voters, nextVoters>>
----
\* The following variables are all per server (functions with domain Servers).

\* The server's term number.
VARIABLE currentTerm
\* The server's state (Follower, Candidate, or Leader).
VARIABLE state
\* The candidate the server voted for in its current term, or
\* Nil if it hasn't voted for any.
VARIABLE votedFor
serverVars == <<currentTerm, state, votedFor,allServers, voters,nextVoters>>

\* The set of requests that can go into the log
VARIABLE clientRequests

\* A Sequence of log entries. The index into this sequence is the index of the
\* log entry. Unfortunately, the Sequence module defines Head(s) as the entry
\* with index 1, so be careful not to use that!
VARIABLE log
\* The index of the latest entry in the log the state machine has commited.
VARIABLE commitIndex
\* The index of the latest entry in the log the state machine has apply.
VARIABLE applyIndex
logVars == <<log, commitIndex, applyIndex, clientRequests>>

\* The following variables are used only on candidates:
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a RequestVote
\* response in its currentTerm.
VARIABLE votesResponded
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a vote in its
\* currentTerm.
VARIABLE votesGranted
\* A history variable used in the proof. This would not be present in an
\* implementation.
\* Function from each server that voted for this candidate in its currentTerm
\* to that voter's log.
VARIABLE voterLog
candidateVars == <<votesResponded, votesGranted, voterLog>>

\* The following variables are used only on leaders:
\* The next entry to send to each follower.
VARIABLE nextIndex
\* The latest entry that each follower has acknowledged is the same as the
\* leader's. This is used to calculate commitIndex on the leader.
VARIABLE matchIndex

leaderVars == <<nextIndex, matchIndex, elections>>

\* End of per server variables.
----

\* All variables; used for stuttering (asserting state hasn't changed).
vars == <<messages, serverVars, candidateVars, leaderVars, logVars>>

----
\* Helpers

\* The set of all quorums. This just calculates simple majorities, but the only
\* important property is that every quorum overlaps with every other.
Quorum(Server) == {i \in SUBSET(Server) : Cardinality(i) * 2 > Cardinality(Server)}

BothQuorum(old, new) == IF old /= {} /\ new /= {} THEN
                           {x[1] \cup x[2]: x \in (Quorum(old) \X Quorum(new))}

                            Quorum(new)
                        ELSE {}
\* The term of the last entry in a log, or 0 if the log is empty.
LastTerm(xlog) == IF Len(xlog) = 0 THEN 0 ELSE xlog[Len(xlog)].term

\* Send a message.
Send(m) == messages' = messages \cup {m}

\* Remove a message from the set of messages. Used when a server is done
\* processing a message.
Discard(m) == messages' = messages \ {m}

\* Combination of Send and Discard.
Reply(reply, request) == messages' = (messages \cup {reply}) \ {request}

\* Return the minimum value from a set, or undefined if the set is empty.
Min(s) == CHOOSE x \in s : \A y \in s : x <= y
\* Return the maximum value from a set, or undefined if the set is empty.
Max(s) == CHOOSE x \in s : \A y \in s : x >= y

\* Get the maximum config from log[1..l].
GetMaxConfigIndex(i, l) ==
    LET chonfigIndexes == {index \in 1..l: log[i][index].type = BeginConfChange \/ log[i][index].type = FinalizeConfChange}
    IN IF chonfigIndexes = {} THEN 0
       ELSE Max(chonfigIndexes)
\* Get the latest config in all log of server i.
GetLatestConfig(i) ==
    LET length == Len(log[i])
        maxIndex == GetMaxConfigIndex(i, length)
    IN IF maxIndex = 0 THEN InitialServers
       ELSE log[i][maxIndex]
\* Get the latest commit config of server i.
